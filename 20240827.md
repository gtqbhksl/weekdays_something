### Summary

Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information in resetpass.go

### Details

On line 67 of the cmd/resetpass.go file, there is a function call called fmt.Println, which may output an error message generated during password resetting. This error message contains the Password is too weak information and related password reset error details. This is a risk of a sensitive data breach. An attacker might analyze the logs to identify weaknesses in the password reset process or gain sensitive information. In addition, if such output is ignored when testing in a development environment, other security risks may arise. Although the password itself is not directly recorded in plain text, such sensitive information leakage can lead to other problems, such as denial of service attacks. Therefore, such information needs to be handled with care.

cmd/resetpass.go line: 67

```go
	err = web.ResetPassword(p.user, newPass2)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("reset password: %v", err)
		return subcommands.ExitFailure
	}
	fmt.Println("Sucess!")
```

### PoC

An attacker can analyze the logs of a target system or service to find error messages that contain sensitive information, from which he may infer weaknesses in the system or weaknesses in policy. This information can be used for targeted attacks or other potential threats. Especially in the large-scale attack scenario, collecting these scattered but important information is one of the common attack methods. Therefore, any log output involving sensitive information should be strictly controlled or avoided.
